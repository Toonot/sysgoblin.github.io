The below report covers information regarding detections of the **top 5** commercial phishing kits from the past week, from `2020-04-27` to `2020-05-04`.  
Commercial phishing kits are those sold by established threat actors or groups to less-skilled individuals, for the express purpose of phishing for credentials and defrauding victims.

[PhishingReel](https://twitter.com/phishingreel) monitors and scans the internet to find these kits being deployed and monitors their activity until the domain is taken down. These reports serve as a weekly update on the current state and trends within the world of SaaS phishing kits.

This report only contains analysis of the top 5 kits detected for the week. For further information please contact me via Twitter or Keybase.
